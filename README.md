# Camera-trap
From Edge to Cloud. A camera trap system.

This repository contains the code and design for our camera trap system.
### Our System
- An OpenMv Camera (The microcontroller of choice)
- A GSM Module (To send collected data from edge to cloud)
- A PIR + Microwave Sensor (Motion sensors a fusion of both to reduce false triggers)

### Motion Sensors
A fusion of PIR and Microwave sensor
(Working principle and significance)

### Person Detection
(Working principle and significance)

### GSM module
(Working principle and significance)
- Sending Videos
- Sending detected persons images

### Video Processing
(What happens to the videos uploaded to the database)
- [Pose Model](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/AJA-pose)
- [Gait Model](https://github.com/kaburia/animal-poses4population)
- (An alternative multimodal approach)
