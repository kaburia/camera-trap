# Camera-trap
From Edge to Cloud: A camera trap system.

This repository contains the code and design for our camera trap system.
### [Our System Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WPm2xWWwLzJluhMEWMM7Aj1WGRfoWpEMaXbJTH9pCGA/edit#heading=h.26j9pw1665s3)
- An OpenMv Camera (The microcontroller of choice)
- A GSM Module (To send collected data from edge to cloud)
- A PIR + Microwave Sensor (Motion sensors a fusion of both to reduce false triggers)

### Motion Sensors
A fusion of PIR and Microwave sensor
(Working principle and significance)

### Person Detection
[(Working principle and significance)](https://github.com/kaburia/camera-trap/tree/main/person-detection)

### GSM module
(Working principle and significance)
- Sending Videos
- Sending detected persons images

### Video Processing
(What happens to the videos uploaded to the database)
